  "GM ! I need help with developing a smart contract and would appreciate any advice on how to approach its implementation , along with suggestions on where I can read more detailed information . Contract requirements : Listing NFTs on the platform for sale .\nSelling NFTs through the platform .\nAllowing sellers to withdraw NFTs from the platform .\nAn important detail : the sale of NFTs should be conducted using FT tokens . I would be grateful for any guidance on the simplest way to implement this , as my previous attempts haven‚Äôt been successful . Proposed contract structure :\nI envision implementing it with four methods , but I‚Äôve encountered some challenges with their development : NFT Listing Method : Accepts the token ID and the price at which the token will be sold . Question : how can I initiate the transfer of the specified NFT token to the contract‚Äôs address within this method ? Price Update Method : Accepts the new token price as a parameter . NFT Purchase Method : Accepts the token ID . Problem : I don‚Äôt yet understand how to set up payment in FT tokens to ensure they‚Äôre transferred to the seller . Token Withdrawal Method : Removes the NFT from the listing . If anyone can explain the approach in simple terms or suggest where to explore this topic in more depth , I‚Äôd be very grateful !",
